            <h5 className="lh-lg">Hello! I'm Narmeta Alekya, a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I have hands-on experience in building responsive, dynamic web applications and am equally comfortable working on both the frontend and backend.<br></br>
                In addition to web development, I am skilled in problem-solving using Python, and I consistently apply logical and structured thinking to tackle complex challenges. I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), where I continue to deepen my knowledge in algorithms, data structures, and system design.
                I enjoy turning ideas into real-world applications and am always eager to learn new technologies and grow as a developer.</h5>
